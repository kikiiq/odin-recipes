# odin-recipes
My first project with TOP. I already know HTML and CSS
so this is not anything new for me.

This is a basic recipe website build with HTML and CSS.

EDIT 
I just finished the HTML part and well now I can't wait to style it with CSS.
I used lists, paragraphs and headings. Also I added pictures.
